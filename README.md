# monkey-sort-rs
Monkey sort is a highly ineffective sorting algorithm, described by the following pseudocode:

```
while not isInOrder(deck):
    shuffle(deck)
```

You can run the program by running:
```
make

# sort an array of 4 elements
cargo run 4

# sort an array of 6 elements
cargo run 6
```
